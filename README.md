Farhan is an open-source application that offers many ways to eliminate manipulative strategies used
by other apps on your phone, so you can eliminate distractions and use your phone!
Included features:

## 1. Delayed app launching

Sometimes you find your self tapping on an app without thinking, delayed app launching will delay
the launch of selected apps by a few seconds so you can think twice before launching them, you can
customize the delay time and the message to display during the delay.

## 2. Notifications filter

Filters notifications for you so you never get distracted, you won't notice them but you can always
exclude important apps so they won't get filtered and you can always check filtered notifications
from within the app.

## 3. Infinite scrolling blocker

Ever realized that you've spent so much time in social media scrolling? not anymore Infinite
scrolling blocker will remind you when it detects infinite scrolling behavior and will help you get
out of that app.

to grayscale and enjoy a color free experience with no red badges or bright colors that catch your
attention.
